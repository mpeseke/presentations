Asking great questions

What makes a good question? 
1. Know what you want and choose carefully. When asking open questions, think of the person you are asking questions responses as doors, each door taking you closer to your goal. Play the long game! 
2. Tactfully ask open ended questions! Again back to the long game, navigate Q and A to acheive the knowledge you need. 
3. Be mindful of how much you are steering a conversation, or not! This goes both ways in development. Emotionally (not so much here, but outside), causal/motives, actions (what have you tried so far? Systems (to understand the entirety of a situation) 
 - Ask for Comparisons/Examples

4. Go with the flow -- this goes especially for the situations you don't know what you don't know until you know that you don't know it? 
5. Listen actively. (Try not to think of your response while the person is communicating their ideas/feedback/knowledge with you.
6. ASK NAIVE QUESTIONS!!!
